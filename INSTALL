In order to run the tests you'll need a working connection to a db2 server running with permissions to create and delete tables.

The connection information is taken from the following environment
variables which you can set to control this behavior:

schema:   ENV{DBD_DB2_SCHEMA}
dbname:   ENV{DBD_DB2_DBNAME}
user:     ENV{DBD_DB2_USER}
password: ENV{DBD_DB2_PASSWD}
table:    ENV{DBD_DB2_TABLE}

If any variable is not set, you are prompted for a value.
